# Course Project

## Description
A console application written in C++ as a course project for one of my university courses - Fundamental Data Structures. It employs different algorithms like Merge-Sort and Boyer-Moore String Pattern Matching algorithm.

#### Additional explanation
This project tries to mimic a real time shop application, which is used in car parts stores. It provides a simple console menu, where the user is presented with different options and can navigate through them back and forth.  

### Object Oriented Approach
